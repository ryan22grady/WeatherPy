### WeatherPy

Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, theyâ€™ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommended adding the weather description to the weather data I've already retrieved in this module. Then, I had the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which was used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
